# Python PDF Utility Project to automate smaller task with PDF Files

## Merge PDF Files

- Simple python script that merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF file using the PyPDF2 library.
- You can specify the paths of the PDF files you want to merge and the output file path where the merged PDF will be saved.
- Make sure to install the PyPDF2 library using pip if you haven't already:
  
  ```pwsh
  pip install PyPDF2
  ```

- Update the file paths in the script to point to your actual PDF files and desired output location.
- Run the script, and it will create a merged PDF file containing all the specified PDFs in the order they were added.
